## Chapter 1: The Rise of AI: Understanding Its Core Capabilities and Global Impact

### Overview of AI Technology: Definitions and Developments

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the application of technology to perform tasks that mimic human cognitive functions. Broadly, AI is defined as "the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior." In practice, AI is a comprehensive umbrella term encompassing a variety of technologies and applications, such as:

- **Machine learning**
- **Deep learning**
- **Neural networks**
- **Natural language processing**
- **Expert systems**
- **Other programming processes**
- **Algorithms**
- **Data**
- **Human feedback**

While there isn't a single universally agreed-upon definition of AI, some of the most notable definitions include:

- "The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages."
- "Getting a computer to do things which, when done by people, are said to involve intelligence."

AI typically involves the development of systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, including visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

AI algorithms, particularly those used for machine learning (ML), consist of complex mathematical models designed to enable machines to learn continuously from new input data. These models develop or adjust outputs based on previous learnings. AI algorithms are not explicitly programmed to perform a task; instead, they are programmed to "learn" to perform the task.

The rise of open-source AI algorithms, made available by leading tech companies, has greatly accelerated innovation in AI and contributed to its broader accessibility, particularly in industries such as finance.

Ensuring the proper structuring and validation of these components is critical for successful AI implementation and development.
